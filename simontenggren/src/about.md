# Hobbies
### Strength training with focus on Powerlifting and Strongman.
I find that strength training clears my mind and releases stress.
It also allows me find something to progress in outside of my studies, reading articles and books on strength trainging is something I do weekly and I love how that it allows me to apply this new knowledge to both improve my own and friends training results.

I have competed in a small Strongman competion and plan on competing in powerlifting in the future.
I currently train at Sundkraft Gym in Lund. (Best gym in Lund ;\))

### Whisk(e)y collection
I collect Whisk(e)y when I can. I enjoy peaty notes such as those from Lagavulin 16, Ardbeg 10, Laphroaig 10, and other distilleries from Islay. But also enjoy some bourbon and smother scottish whiskies.

### Configuraton
I like customizing my possessions so that they work and feel they way I want it to.

Examples including customizing my desktop for both aesthetic and productivity purposes. Writing my own scripts, shortcuts, downloading fonts, typesetting with Latex, etc.
Modding the games that I play, photoshopping images are also some things I do when I get time and need.
